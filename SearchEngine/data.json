All the players, including those on the bench and the staff, ran to celebrate in front of the visiting supporters.\nInsigne, who is leaving Napoli at the end of the season after 15 years to join Toronto FC in Major League Soccer, had scored the opener in the 62nd minute. He also had another goal ruled out for offside.\nNapoli moved above Milan on goal difference. Head-to-head is the first tiebreaker if sides are level on points at the end of the season. Napoli won 1-0 when the two sides met in December.\nNapoli was without a win in its previous four matches and coach Luciano Spalletti hit back at the team's critics after the victory.\n\"I would like to underline the fact that everyone was stupidly critical about this team, saying we didn't have character. They even said that this week. It's exactly the opposite,\" Spalletti said.\n\"In general there's an ugly atmosphere around Napoli, people saying that the players are soft but instead they have character. I want to see what they say nowâ€¦ we are fighting at the top of the table.\""}

Thiago Alcantara and Virgil van Djik also found the net for the home team.\nThe Reds now sit one point behind Chelsea, who host Manchester United on Sunday.\nSteven Gerrard's winning start in the Premier League continued as Aston Villa won 2-1 away to Crystal Palace to make it two wins from two games since he joined from Glasgow Rangers.\nMatt Targett put Villa ahead in the 15th minute following a corner and John McGinn's first time shot five minutes from time assured the win even though Marc Guehi scored a late consolation goal for the home side.\nArsenal returned to winning ways after last weekend's 4-0 defeat to Liverpool with a 2-0 win at home to Newcastle United leaving the visitors without a win in their first 13 games of the season.\nNewcastle coach Eddie Howe was able to sit in the dugout for the first time after recovering from the COVID-19 and saw how second half goals from Bakary Saka and Gabriel Martinelli condemned his side to defeat.\nMeanwhile, Norwich City picked up another point to extend their unbeaten run to three games with a 0-0 draw at home to Wolves. Norwich will be disappointed to not pick up all three points after Wolves keeper Jose Sa denied both Teemu Pukki and Lukas Rupp with late saves.\nIn Saturday's last game, Brighton and Leeds United drew 0-0 in a result that extended Brighton's winless run to eight games. Brighton had most of the chances, but familiar failings in front of goal cost them the chance of a win."}
